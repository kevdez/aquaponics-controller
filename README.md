Aquaponics Arduino Controller and Server
-------------------

These are sketches for the Arduino as a controller for sensing data from a self-sustaining aquaponics system.

Be sure to change *.c files to *.ino. 

Hardware requirements:
	Arduino Wifi-Shield
	Humidity/Air Temperature Sensor
	Water Temperature sensor

The imported Arduino libraries are:
	SPI.h
	WiFi.h
	dht.h
	SD.h
	OneWire.h
